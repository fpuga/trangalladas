* DESCRIPTION: Join a SHP Layer with a CVS file. Process: Open the SHP Layer in the gui.
* Execute the funcion run() in BeanShell. Close the Layer.
* .shp, .dbf, .shx and the .cvs that contains the data that must be joined have to be in the same directory.
* Read the comments of the variables in funcion run() for additional info
